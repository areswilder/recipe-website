    <p>In order to ensure the oats don’t mess with the pancakes’ light and fluffy texture, soaking is key. Simply combine rolled oats with milk in your mixing bowl and let them hang out for 10 minutes while you gather your other ingredients. The oats will soften and start to break down, ensuring your pancakes won’t taste too hearty and the oats are easier to digest and absorb.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup oats</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>Tbs Sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk 1 cup rolled oats and 1 cup milk together in a large bowl. Let stand for 10 minutes for the oats to soften.</li>
        <li>Add the butter, 2 eggs, and 1 tablespoon granulated sugar to the oats, and whisk to combine.</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon butter to the pan and swirl to coat. Drop the batter into the pan in 2-tablespoon portions, cooking 3 at a time. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, the edges begin to look dry, and the bottoms are golden-brown, about 3 minutes. Flip the pancakes and cook until the other side is golden-brown, 2 to 3 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
